# ActiveMDX Next.js Blog Example

This project uses [ActiveMDX](https://github.com/soederpop/active-mdx) with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) to present structured writing.

Next and MDX let us display our writing with its own Custom UI with React Components.

ActiveMDX lets us develop an API for the data and concepts contained in the writing itself.
