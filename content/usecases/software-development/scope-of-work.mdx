# Scope of Work

In the [Introduction](./introduction.mdx) we wrote a project requirement document which contained several `Epics`.

Those `Epics` contain multiple `Stories` which are things a team of designers, devlopers, and QA will work on to deliver the software.

In this example, we'll show how we can use these documents and the data contained in them to generate a scope of work that a client could sign off on and agree to spend money on.

The source code for all of these documents can be [viewed on Github]
